This package contains the code for my solutions to the exercises in
the 2nd edition of Abelson and Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs_. Unless otherwise specified, all of the
solutions were written and tested using Chicken Scheme 2.6 or later on
a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.5. The solutions are licensed under
the GNU GPL version 3.

The code is organized by chapter and exercise number. For example, the
code for the solution to exercise 2.42 in chapter 2 is contained in
the file named ex2.42.scm in the chap2/ subdirectory.

The Scheme files contain only the code needed to solve the problem
posed by the exercise. For detailed explanations of the code in each
solution, see the solution's corresponding page on my wiki. An index
of all available solutions can be found on the SICP solutions category
page:

http://wiki.drewhess.com/wiki/Category:SICP_solutions

Please also see the category page for information on running the code
contained in this package on various Scheme implementations.

Some of the exercises in SICP pose problems whose solutions don't
require any code at all. Such exercises only have a wiki page, and no
corresponding Scheme file.

Note: This package is a work-in-progress -- I haven't finished reading
the text yet. I'll add new solutions as I get around to them.
