The solutions transform the tree to a sorted list, perform the
algorithms developed in the text and in exercise 2.62.

I don't think it's possible to implement union-set or intersection-set
such that they operate directly on the tree representation and still
perform in O(n) time. (Possibly with continuations?)

tests:

(define s1 (list->tree '(1 2 3 5 6 8 10 11)))

(define s2 (list->tree '(2 4 6 8 11 13)))

(tree->list (union-set s1 s2))

(tree->list (intersection-set s1 s2))
